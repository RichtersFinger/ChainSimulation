# Simple Chain Simulator

Compile using for example
   ```console
   $ g++ ChainElement.cpp ChainLink.cpp Chain.cpp Simulation.cpp main.cpp -std=c++11 -o run
   ```
   
The output data is written to the subdirectory `data/`. Use for example the provided gnuplot script `plot.plt` to plot the results.

See also the [demonstration](https://youtu.be/O_HGXQ6sR9I) for an example application for the simulation of the chain fountain or Mould effect.
